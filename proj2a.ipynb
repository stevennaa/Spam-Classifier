    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting\n",

As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate.

    "We would like to take the text of an email and predict whether the email is ham or spam. This is a *classification* problem, so we can use logistic regression to train a classifier. Recall that to train a logistic regression model we need a numeric feature matrix $X$ and a vector of corresponding binary labels $y$.  Unfortunately, our data are text, not numbers. To address this, we can create numeric features derived from the email text and use those features for logistic regression.\n",
